## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Two-Class System Design**
```javascript
// Core Architecture Pattern
EEGSimulator    // Canvas rendering, animation, wave mathematics, user controls
EEGEducation    // Modal dialogs, quiz system, comparison features, educational content
```

### **Advanced Canvas Rendering Pipeline**
- **Dual-canvas system**: Main EEG display + Frequency spectrum analyzer
- **Optimized rendering**: clearRect() → drawGrid() → drawWaves() → drawTimeMarker()
- **Mathematical wave synthesis**: `sin(t × frequency × 0.5 + phaseShift) × amplitude × weight`
- **Hardware acceleration**: RequestAnimationFrame at 60fps for smooth performance
- **Memory optimization**: Object pooling and efficient DOM manipulation

### **State Management**
```javascript
// Central state management in EEGSimulator
this.isPlaying = true;        // Animation control
this.showAllWaves = false;    // Display mode toggle  
this.currentWave = 'delta';   // Active wave type
this.time = 0;               // Animation time counter
```

### **Wave Data Structure**
```javascript
// Single wave mode
{ frequency: 10, color: '#FF9800', channels: 8 }

// Composite mode (all waves)
{ frequency: 10, color: '#FF9800', amplitude: 0.5 }
```

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Efficient drawing loops**: Optimized pixel-level rendering with reduced calculations
- **Event delegation**: Minimized event listeners with proper cleanup
- **Responsive updates**: Debounced user inputs to prevent excessive recalculations
- **CSS hardware acceleration**: GPU-accelerated transitions and animations
